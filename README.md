## Basic Python to Squrriel Transplier
(This is a very obvious copy of p2r3/peanut, don't ask) \
\
A Python transplier of Python to Squrriel, created for ease in quickly mocking up scripts for compatible Source Engine games. \
Does not have all features of Python converted to Squrriel. Only lexical references and required functions will be converted. \
Will keep up with updates if needed. \
\
* Known Issues
	*Explicit/Implicit line joining is not supported. Unknown if Squrriel supports.
